## Contracts

### mpay.compact (10 circuits)

| Category | Circuits |
|----------|----------|
| Setup | constructor, initSigner, finalize |
| Deposit | deposit |
| Propose | propose (generic, txType selects transfer/addSigner/removeSigner/setThreshold) |
| Approve | approveTx |
| Rescue | stampReady (re-evaluates pending tx against current threshold; open to anyone) |
| Execute | executeTransfer, executeAddSigner, executeRemoveSigner, executeSetThreshold |
| Pure | deriveCommitment, computeNullifier |

17 ledger fields. `executeTransfer` reads 3 of them (signers.member, txStatuses.lookup, vaultCoin.lookup) to stay within Midnight's `fields + reads ≤ 20` budget when using `sendShielded`.

### token.compact (1 circuit)

| Category | Circuits |
|----------|----------|
| Setup | constructor |
| Token | mint (`mintShieldedToken` + `sendShielded` to recipient) |
| Pure | deriveCommitment |

## Transaction Types

| Type | Propose | Execute | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | proposeTransfer(coin, encData) | executeTransfer(txId, coinKey) | Transfer from vault to recipient. Encrypts (cpk, epk, amount) under vault key. |
| 2 | proposeAddSigner(commitment) | executeAddSigner(txId) | Add new signer |
| 3 | proposeRemoveSigner(commitment) | executeRemoveSigner(txId) | Remove signer (keeps count >= threshold) |
| 4 | proposeSetThreshold(value) | executeSetThreshold(txId) | Change approval threshold |

## Privacy Model

| Private (ZK / encrypted) | Public (on-chain) |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Signer identity — secret never leaves browser | Signer commitments (hashes, not linked to wallet identity) |
| Who approved which transaction (nullifiers are unlinkable) | Approval count per transaction |
| Transfer recipient + amount (AES-GCM encrypted, signers with vault key decrypt) | Threshold value |
| Shielded coin ownership (Zswap) | Vault coin values (visible as coin value on-chain) |
| Deposit source (shielded UTXO unlinkable) | Transaction types and statuses |
| Which signer executed | Contract address |

## Encrypted proposal layout

Stored in `txData0-3` (4 × 32 bytes = 128 bytes). `txData0` is repurposed from the original `dataHash` slot — the circuit doesn't verify it for Transfer txs.

- Plaintext: `recipientCpk(32) + recipientEpk(32) + amount(16)` = 80 bytes
- AES-256-GCM ciphertext: 96 bytes + 12 IV = 108 bytes
- Spread across 4 chunks (enc0 carries IV + first 20 ct bytes; enc3 has 20 bytes padding)

On decryption, `TransactionsTab` rebuilds the full `mn_shield-addr_...` via the `ShieldedAddress` codec using both keys.
